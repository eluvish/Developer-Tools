    <p style="font-family: Verdana;">
    This (small) website provides developers with three simple tools to aid the web development process.<br><br>
    The first tool is a Lorem Ipsum generator. For those unfamiliar, it aids development by providing random text in the form of paragraphs.<br><br>
    The second tool is a random user generator. It currently supplies a (1) name, (2) email address, and (3) a short profile made up of Lorem Ipsum text.<br><br>
    The third and final tool is an xkcd style password generator.<br><br>
    Use the icons above to get to each generator or you can use the small buttons as a quick way to generate say 3 paragraphs of Lorem Ipsum, or 6 random users, etc.
